steve,

here at coursera we care a lot about open source and contributing back where we can, but we can do better at it.
given your incredible work on video.js (which we are using quite extensively now), we think that you could help teach us
how to be better open source maintainers and better open source contributors.

come give a talk at coursera, maybe?

jon & team
